For a non-negative integer `X`, the array-form of X is an array of its digits in left to right order.  For example, if `X = 1231`, then the array form is `[1,2,3,1]`.

Given the array-form A of a non-negative integer X, return the array-form of the integer X+K

Example 1:

```
Input: A = [1,2,0,0], K = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234
```

Example 2:

```
Input: A = [2,7,4], K = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455

```
