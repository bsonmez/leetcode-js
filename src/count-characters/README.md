# 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words.`

Example 1:

```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

**Note:**

- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
- All strings contain lowercase English letters only.
